  <title>Which Programming Language Should I Pick?</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Which programming language is right for you?</h1>

  <p class="intro">It can be hard to know which language is best when you’re not a programmer yet, but you don’t have to understand everything about each programming language to choose the one that’s right for you. Each language has it’s own particular uses, as well as pros and cons. If you have a clear idea of your reasons for learning to program, and know exactly what you want to accomplish with your new coding skills, then you’ll be able to make the right choice by taking the quiz below.</p>
